We depend on privacy and anonymity tech, including Monero [XMR]. Monero has lofty goals and powerful privacy claims that fall short in actual operation. As an example: All network communications are unencrypted which allows a passive adversary to easily de-anonymize many transactions. Instead: Monero should be encrypted and easily integrate with Tor to hide user activity. Contract 1: We desire an engineer to contribute to the Monero open source project. This includes adding encryption between nodes, reducing wallet metadata leakage, and integrating Tor into both the client [easy] and the node software [more challenging]. Contract 2: We need someone to write a simulator and improve blockchain explorer tools to determine how well Monero's privacy claims truly hold up. To-date there is no public research on fundamental aspect of Monero. We want to be able to have answers to the questions of how private a user becomes when using Monero. How often must a user send money to themselves [churn] to effectively hide among X users? We want to make proposals to change the Monero network parameters to improve privacy and have the evidence to make the case. All work will be published openly and you can take the credit with a note that PinkDate is the sponsor. You should be comfortable engaging with community and defending design decisions and research. Note: PinkDate is an extrajurisdictional company and pays contractors in cryptocurrencies as a transfer mechanism. We price contracts in USD. If you like the idea of working on an underground project: We often have contracts or positions available in legal, security, [counter]intelligence, devops and general software engineering.

16735274,"Academia.edu | Full Stack Engineer | San Francisco, CA | Onsite"," Academia.edu is addressing two problems: - Open access. The goal here is to put every academic pdf ever written on the internet, available for free. - Robustness. The goal here is to produce a set of signals around any given academic paper that indicate how robust the paper’s claims and findings are. It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the academic literature is not reproducible. What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as ""the reproducibility crisis”. Peer review is not a robustness filter; we need a separate filter to indicate robustness. With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 19 million pdfs to Academia.edu. About 30 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers. With regard to robustness, we think the way to build a robustness layer on top of papers is a) to mine the existing graph of citations for commentary and (b) crowd-source commentary/peer review from the academic community. Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (b), and a citation graph infrastructure that is the basis of our approach to (a). We believe that addressing robustness is a challenge and an opportunity. We need mission-driven engineers to come and help us. We have raised $33 million from Tencent, Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. The company is profitable off a premium subscription model.

The phrase that most aptly describes us is “boutique consulting firm” as we are currently working on select software consulting projects and have a long term vision to build a stand-alone product in about 6 months. The future product will focus on enabling business workflows and growing workplace productivity. We are being smart in our approach balancing software consulting with our own product. We balance both to pay ourselves well and support our vision for the future. We're looking to get one final person in place to help us build our product, and that is hopefully you. We are incredibly selective (who isn't?) and we are really quite small. We've blogged about our hiring process and we've blogged about our funnel. The reality is we've optimized our hiring process to filter first, before a call. We're sorry this is the case; it would be really nice to meet everyone, but we simply don't have the time to do that while also working on our business. We try to be as transparent as we can be about our process, but if it doesn't work for you we'd love to hear from you when we're bigger and having a recruiting division who will be able to do a call first approach. We have a vision of a product but we don't have one yet, so we can't point you to it. Sorry! Also, we're forthright about this (see the first line of this post) but we really and truly only hire employees authorized to work in the US. We're not large enough to want to deal with non-US tax jurisdictions, and we're not looking for 1099 contractors at this time. Who you are: An incredibly motivated, amazingly talented full stack engineer whose abilities truly shine on the front end. You know React, Webpack, CSS, Sass, JSX, and the other standard front-end technologies we don't. You are a self-starter who can work with little supervision.

We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. Our back-end is primarily Ruby on Rails, although we are working to split off smaller services as we scale to keep up with our traffic. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2] In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time.

We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using Chef and OpsWorks. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production. We’re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they’re right.

We build highly customised applications with lots of business logic on top of integrated products, and our API design and development processes must enable this to be maintainable and sustainable in the long term. * We care about quality and doing things right.

We spend our time thinking deeply about the structure of language and then building statistical models that capture the structure. The requirements are: a good background in mathematics and statistics, and a deep interest in language and linguistics. Programming skill is a big plus, but not an absolute requirement. I believe we are poised to make a huge dent in the world of NLP and linguistics. The field of automated parsing has been bogged down for the last 20 years because of its dependence on labelled training data (e.g the Penn Treebank). In my research I've discovered a way to circumvent that limitation, by building and evaluating sentence parsers using only a large amount of raw text data. I've spent the last couple of years validating the approach, and now that I'm confident it works, I'm looking to build up a team. I have a nontraditional, minimalist and cockroachy business plan that won't appeal to everyone, but I can promise you that if I get rich you will also. I can also guarantee that you will get a ton of great experience that you would be tough to get at a big company. I want to especially encourage the following types of people to reach out: - Recent grads in language-related fields who want to break into the software engineering industry - People who have had some success in mainstream software engineering careers, but are looking to try something new - People who want are thinking about going to graduate school in CS/ML/AI/NLP and want some experience doing research in that area I'm happy to talk more about the specifics in person.

Did you smile reading that last part? Good, it’s more fun when you have a sense of humor. We’re working on changing the game with the backing of the world’s largest VPN service. An unstoppable multi-protocol decentralized onion routing system that is going to weave privacy into the very fabric of the Internet. Like TOR, if TOR was embedded into everything, had sensible economic incentive mechanisms, and was resistant to sybil attacks. # Scale of initial deployment Servers : 100K+ Traffic : Exabytes Users : Millions # Things you probably already know in and out IP networking, onion routing, VPNs, applied cryptography & blockchains at the protocol level. # Things you’ll wonder when you read the prototype Apache module for fun - Why don’t most HTTP proxies support keep-alives? - Can you add a flag to the HTTP_PIPE contract to specify whether or not to use Global Session Support (GSS)? - Is there a better way to track a single session across separate processes other than keeping track of session state in shared memory?

You will take ownership, train and grow the data engineering and statistical learning (""data science"") team of the largest e-logistics company in South East Asia. Likely useful experience: <pre><code>  - Software development (aside from building actual software, you'll need to read a lot of code to understand systems whose logic is not at database level).

  - A mathematical bend, including awareness of and respect for the ideas behind the relational model (""predicate logic on sets"") as defined by Edgar Codd and Chris Date, and rich data types. If you see a foreign key as a mathematical domain and think in terms of relation values and variables, we are probably on the same page.

  - Knowing your way around PostgreSQL, or failing that any large scale RDBMS deployment; there are infrastructure teams and DBAs but they need your guidance.

  - At least some enjoyment of the resolution of large, complex problems using more abstract methods as opposed to quick hacks and duct tape. 

  - UNIX/Linux, but if you've read that far you probably have more than enough experience.

  - Speaking Chinese (Mandarin) may help a bit but the team has multiple native speakers.

16498556,"Academia.edu | Full Stack Engineer | San Francisco, CA | Onsite"," Academia.edu is addressing two problems: - Open access. The goal here is to put every academic pdf ever written on the internet, available for free. - Robustness. The goal here is to produce a set of signals around any given academic paper that indicate how robust the paper’s claims and findings are. It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the academic literature is not reproducible. What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as ""the reproducibility crisis”. Peer review is not a robustness filter; we need a separate filter to indicate robustness. With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 19 million pdfs to Academia.edu. About 30 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers. With regard to robustness, we think the way to build a robustness layer on top of papers is a) to mine the existing graph of citations for commentary and (b) crowd-source commentary/peer review from the academic community. Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (b), and a citation graph infrastructure that is the basis of our approach to (a). We believe that addressing robustness is a challenge and an opportunity. We need mission-driven engineers to come and help us. We have raised $33 million from Tencent, Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. The company is profitable off a premium subscription model. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes ""We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world.""
