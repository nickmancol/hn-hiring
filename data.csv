16498556,"Academia.edu | Full Stack Engineer | San Francisco, CA | OnsiteAcademia.edu is addressing two problems:- O","Academia.edu | Full Stack Engineer | San Francisco, CA | OnsiteAcademia.edu is addressing two problems:- Open access. The goal here is to put every academic pdf ever written on the internet, available for free.- Robustness. The goal here is to produce a set of signals around any given academic paper that indicate how robust the paper’s claims and findings are.It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the academic literature is not reproducible. What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as ""the reproducibility crisis”. Peer review is not a robustness filter; we need a separate filter to indicate robustness.With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 19 million pdfs to Academia.edu. About 30 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers.With regard to robustness, we think the way to build a robustness layer on top of papers is a) to mine the existing graph of citations for commentary and (b) crowd-source commentary/peer review from the academic community.Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (b), and a citation graph infrastructure that is the basis of our approach to (a). We believe that addressing robustness is a challenge and an opportunity. We need mission-driven engineers to come and help us.We have raised $33 million from Tencent, Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. The company is profitable off a premium subscription model. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes ""We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world.""We are looking to hire full stack software engineers. Technologies we use include Ruby, Rails, Postgres, DynamoDB, React. Our office is in downtown San Francisco. For more information, visit http://academia.edu/hiring.If you are interested to learn more, please email Richard Price at richard [at] academia.edu

    - highly skilled on both the frontend and backend. our stack is React + Rails.

    - solid fundamental understanding of how quality software is built, and best practices. 

    - an understanding of UI/UX, and a keen “eye” for design.  this is difficult to gauge, but its very important that we’re on a similar wavelength.

    - The ability to put development efforts in the context of business and customer needs. must be able to distinguish between what is “fun” and what’s “mission critical”. this is harder than it sounds.. emotions have a way of clouding judgement.

    - Fast speed and a high level of output. you should be able to deliver at least 2-3x faster than most. I work extremely fast so I expect as much from our lead engineer. I value execution much more than perfection.

Part of the solution is the long-overdue modernization of our nation's health IT infrastructure. This is CareEvolution's mission - to create better patient outcomes by modernizing - and connecting - our health IT systems.We're looking for someone to fill a technical communicator role to manage building and maintaining our internal and external documentation, to write journal articles, to do some wiki management, to produce video tutorials etc.  A high degree of technical expertise is required, as are excellent writing and communication skills and a background in health IT.  This role also likely entails managing customer questions and requests as it relates to documentation - and executing on them. The ideal candidate will have expertise in at least some of the following: HTML, XML, basic Git, basic graphic design, basic SQL, understanding and using REST and other web services, basic video editing and production.

It has often been said that data is the new currency.  Unfortunately, maximizing the value of data is often easier said than done.  On one side, transacting via individual point to point integrations carries a lot of overhead in both business development and technical integration efforts.  On the other, going through big aggregators introduces opacity in the pricing and provenance of the data.  At Narrative, we help our customers get value from their data by building a central auction platform to reduce the friction and tooling to increase the transparency in this process.We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch.  Here's where we are now:- We are operating in Amazon Web Services.  Our services are mainly deployed on EC2 provisioned with Terraform.- We also heavily use other technology on AWS such as DynamoDB, S3, and RDS.- Our backend includes a data ingestion web service with supporting Kinesis consumers, along with a growing array of Spark projects.  It’s written mostly in Scala, with a smattering of Python for lambda functions.- We sit somewhere in the middle of the “Scala as a worse Haskell” and “Scala as a better Java” spectrum.  We love functional programming and we do make use of libraries like cats, but at the same time we heavily favor core language features and have no intention of rewriting everything using Free Monads.- Our frontend is written in Typescript with Angular2 and a supporting API running on Node, and is deployed and monitored using much the same supporting tech as the backend.- Other services we use include: GitHub, CircleCI, DataDog.Find out about Company Culture: http://transparency.narrative.io/culture/Apply at hiring@narrative.io.

There are a lot of fascinating and challenging problems in this area: computing taxi times, landing times, departure times, airport congestion, flight delays, and more based on complex real-time contextual information. I honestly believe these are among the most interesting problems you'll find to work on almost anywhere.FlightAware has a vast amount of highly granular flight data going back many years to facilitate tackling these problems. For instance, we have detailed surface movement data for all aircraft on the ground at most major worldwide airports. We have detailed weather records and radar imagery. We have thousands of live ADS-B receivers around the world. And we've partnered with Aireon to deploy ADS-B receivers in space on dozens of satellites in orbit; this will allow us to achieve global tracking coverage, even over the oceans and other large bodies of water.FlightAware wants to be on the forefront of tackling these problems using modern, sophisticated methods. We view this as a long-term strategic initiative for the company.You'd be the first full-time machine learning engineer, so we're looking for someone fairly senior and experienced. You won't be a cog in the machine. This is not just a research position and will involve building end-to-end production systems, from training pipelines to real-time inference engines, so we're ideally looking for someone with a demonstrated track record of doing so. With that said, we're willing to consider less experienced candidates with exceptional backgrounds.FA is a small company (currently 70-80 employees), but we're not a startup.

Which is to say we do fun and interesting stuff.We are now looking for a senior Unity and C# developer to join us. Our team is still small - you'd be employee no. 10. What this means is that we still operate in WYSIWYG mode - the correlation between your actions in the workplace and the outcome is clear and discernible. The role comes with a wide range of tasks, high degree of responsibility, and an ample amount of freedom.A bit about you. You probably earned some kind of diploma in computer science or a game-related field (unless you’re a self-taught savant). Afterwards you’ve meticulously honed your craft in various established organizations for half a dozen of years or so. In addition to great products, over time you’ve also built your set of soft skills. You can not only solve problems but also communicate your solutions to others. You may have been exposed to stuff like office politics and ladder climbing, and rightfully decided you want nothing to do with it. You prefer to disseminate knowledge rather than gossip. And somehow - almost miraculously - deep inside you still feel the fire to write clean code, make smart game design decisions, and lead younger team members with a smile.Basically we want you know your shit, get shit done, and not be a shit to others. It’s a tall order, for sure, but you’ll get to work with people who exude those qualities as well.This is a full-time salaried position in Toronto. (Un)fortunately we don’t have a legal team so we can’t help you with getting a visa - you need to be able to work in Canada for this one. Send your resume to ivan@seedinteractive.co (n.b. we are big believers in one page CVs) and write a few sentences why are you the best person for the job so we know that you care (and could judge your persuasion skills and spelling).TL;DR: Unity & C# senior dev lead who’s also a jolly good chap

We believe in the transformative power of learning, and are passionate about social justice and breaking down barriers that prevent people from reaching their full potential.We started 5 years ago with KA Lite (https://learningequality.org/ka-lite/), an offline-installable platform bundling Khan Academy content and our own student tracking tools, which is being used in nearly 200 countries and territories.We're now in the process of releasing our second-generation platform, Kolibri (https://learningequality.org/kolibri/), which empowers users to create, curate, share, and learn from diverse forms of openly licensed content, both online and offline. We're building tools for authoring videos and exercises, an app ecosystem for embedding and distributing HTML5 educational bundles, features for discovering and communicating with other devices peer-to-peer over a local network, interfaces and web-based visualizations for exploring student data, and systems for motivating, engaging, and guiding learners. On the backend, we use Python/Django, and on the frontend we use Vue.js and (in one project) Backbone.js.We recently received significant funding from Google.org to support our work (https://www.google.org/our-work/education/learning-equality/), and our team has doubled from 10 to 20 full-time staff in the past year. We're now building out further to support new initiatives, including a project for refugee education with UNHCR, and to continue to build towards our longer-term vision. It's an exciting period of growth, both for our team and for our impact, and there are lots of ways you could make a difference!# Who you areYou care deeply about making the world a better place, believe in the power of learning, strive to promote equality, and resonate with our statement of core values (https://learningequality.org/about/values/).

We also help call centres offload voice volume on to chat. We also do predictive modelling for demand (not just in call centres: retail as well).We are a well-funded startup with a long runway to support our current 20 staff. We're making large $$$$ sales into enterprises most weeks. We have mature management (two ex-googlers are on the management team, including the former Australian general manager; the rest of the executive team have held senior roles across the banks, successful startups and a variety of other major corporations). You get the stability and mature culture of a large corporate job, but the interesting work and dynamic environment of a startup.We have a team of data scientists already; I'm looking to hire one more, preferably with skills in computer vision.I am looking to hire around 3-5 software developers to take on various projects. There are existing projects in Python, but we are seriously considering switching to Go or Haskell for the bulk of future development. (If you are only interested in a Haskell role, or only interested in a Go role, just mention it in your resume.)What I would like from a software developer is a lot of experience of working with data scientists and/or some machine learning skills yourself. Having taken projects through to production and supporting them there is also valuable.The call centre application is the most important one, so experience with NLP, Twilio and call centre software (e.g. Genesys) will get you to the top of the resume pile. On the other hand, if you are happen to have some knowledge around point-of-sale systems, forecasting, stock and warehousing systems and so on, that will get you to the top of the resume pile for the demand modelling part.I also need some devops folks: in particular, we have a platform that helps speed data science projects through the cycle from jupyter notebook -> software development -> in production system; I'm looking to hire someone who can own that product and provide insight into what production problems could be avoided by baking things into code at an earlier stage in development.https://www.workable.com/j/2A144554F9  or contact careers@daisee.com and mention that you saw this post on HN.

We count on Software Designers to inspire teams of the possibilities enabled by software, computing, and programmatic thinking, providing unorthodox ways to push design. They first-hand enact our mission of humanizing technology: starting from first principles to ask the right questions, of people, technology, and systems.One or more below could be your focus areas:- Physical/Digital. You’re a Creative Technologist who works with software and hardware to create connected installations, experiences, and augmented objects. Your skills may include electrical engineering, micro-controllers, sensors, creative coding, or robotics.- Emergent Interactions. You’re a pioneering Software-meets-Interaction Designer who works with emergent edge technology to explore new interactions at the frontier of what’s possible.

You understand web or device-native development, along with the iterative agile dev process, and how to position products for scale and impact. You have a secret crush on business design.- Digital Immersion. You’re an Illusion Technologist, crafting intangibles like “feeling,” via code. You guide people across the uncanny valley by working with software to create immersive experiences, games, or interactive narratives.

Our team is based in San Francisco and we are well-funded by top investors in the space.Cryptocurrency is a domain where correctness really counts. As such, we focus on building reliable software through the use of statically-typed functional programming languages. This is reflected in our OCaml codebase and style of structuring code around DSLs, as well as in the design of the smart-contracts platform we're developing.There is no need to have prior experience in cryptography, and we're hiring engineers to work on a bunch of exciting projects including:* Our OCaml DSL for writing zk-SNARKs (a cryptographic primitive for certified computation).* The design of a virtual machine and higher-level languages for smart contracts (there a lot of interesting challenges here since the VM has to be efficient inside SNARKs).* Working on the core networking, cryptography, and reliability aspects of the protocol.This is a chance to join a small, collaborative team and have a ton of independence while working on fascinating cross-disciplinary problems in computing. We also offer competitive compensation both in salary and equity as well as top-of-the-market benefits.Please get in touch by sending an email with your resume and the subject ""Engineer applicant"" to jobs@o1labs.org (I'm the CTO and will read/respond personally.)"

Kadena is poised to become the leading blockchain platform for businesses and enterprises by solving scalability and security concerns that impede widespread blockchain adoption. Our existing technology stack consists of our open-source smart contract language Pact and our private-chain protocol ScalableBFT, products that are already in use with Fortune-100 clients and coded entirely in Haskell. We firmly believe Haskell lends a decisive advantage through drastically enhanced productivity, excellent concurrency and parallelization support, unbeatable programming-language tooling, and sheer pleasure of coding. We’ve built a lot with just two devs, we can’t wait to see what you will add to our stack!The ideal candidate will be able to work closely with a group but also drive projects independently. Developers are encouraged to interact at every level of product development. Initial focus is on building out our new public-chain protocol Chainweb and furthering our work in formal verification of Pact smart contracts; later projects will include operational pieces for the public platform like load balancers, monitoring, and messaging systems. Finally, partner integrations can lead to entirely new products integrating Pact smart contracts with bespoke systems. Public-chain projects are entirely open source (BSD3), and contributions to other projects are encouraged as well.Exposure and expertise in any of the following areas is desirable:- Network engineering- Cryptography engineering- Distributed Systems- Programming language design (e.g. compilers, interpreters, development tools)- Database Systems (RDBMS but also key-value systems)- Software assurance/verification (Coq, SMTLIB2, QuickCheck, Jepsen, Coq, HOL)- Industrial/production Haskell developmentTo apply please send a resume to hiring+hn@kadena.io."

Who we are: We are a small company loathe to use the word “startup”. The phrase that most aptly describes us is “boutique consulting firm” as we are currently working on select software consulting projects and have a long term vision to build a stand-alone product in about a year. The future product will focus on enabling business workflows and growing workplace productivity. We are being smart in our approach balancing software consulting with our own product. We balance both to pay ourselves well and support our vision for the future.Who you are: You are a self-starter who can work with little supervision. You are meticulous about details and sufficiently passionate to get things done, yet know when to pivot to a more experimental move-fast mode. You should be a great teammate who looks to make your colleagues more productive because you know they are doing the same for you. You love the state-of-the-art and yet understand the danger of being there and can articulate the reasons why.Technologies:NodeJS / JavaScriptBabel / ES6RDMS: MySQL / PostgresAmazon Web Services: EC2, Lambda, CloudFront, S3GitHubApache Aurora / MesosTerraformDockerWe’re open to new technologies too, in the right situation.https://www.builtforme.techhttps://blog.builtforme.techApply via AngelList: https://angel.co/builtforme/jobs/"

Stan emerged from the research group under Andrew Gelman at Columbia, which is focused on state-of-the-art in Bayesian inference methodology and consulted on a variety of statistical problems in the social, biological, and physical sciences, engineering, sports, and business. Since its initial release, we’ve welcomed collaborators and contributors across the globe and have about 30 active contributors at the time of writing.We’re looking for a tools and infrastructure developer who is interested in science and open source, is a self-starter and intrinsically motivated to help out, wants a flexible lifestyle, and would like to learn Bayesian stats and data analysis. Ideally you’d come in knowing a decent amount about either systems administration or programming (or both) and we would teach you about statistics. We’re looking for help with the following problems initially:
* Streamlining installation for our R and Python interfaces for scientists on Windows and Mac, perhaps creating installers for each platform
* Maintaining and improving our continuous integration infrastructure (currently Jenkins, Travis, AWS)
* Bringing the PyStan interface up to feature parity with RStan and improving both of them (Python)
* Higher order autodiff test framework and infrastructure (C++)We expect that you will need to spend a significant portion of your time on at least some of these problems at first. Beyond that, there is much work to be done on Stan as an ecosystem. For example, we could also use help with the following key underserved areas of the project:
* Profiling and performance benchmarks and improvements
* Various refactorings, mostly in C++ 
* Pedagogical materials
* GPU and distributed computation supportThere are also many other ways to improve Stan that could use helping hands:
* Stan 3.0 language and/or compiler rewrite
* CloudStan
* Graphical modeling language transpiler
* New algorithm research implementations

It has often been said that data is the new currency.  Unfortunately, maximizing the value of data is often easier said than done.  On one side, transacting via individual point to point integrations carries a lot of overhead in both business development and technical integration efforts.  On the other, going through big aggregators introduces opacity in the pricing and provenance of the data.  At Narrative, we help our customers get value from their data by building a central auction platform to reduce the friction and tooling to increase the transparency in this process.We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch.  Here's where we are now:- We are operating in Amazon Web Services.  Our services are mainly deployed on EC2 provisioned with Terraform.- We also heavily use other technology on AWS such as DynamoDB, S3, and RDS.- Our backend includes a data ingestion web service with supporting Kinesis consumers, along with a growing array of Spark projects.  It’s written mostly in Scala, with a smattering of Python for lambda functions.- We sit somewhere in the middle of the “Scala as a worse Haskell” and “Scala as a better Java” spectrum.  We love functional programming and we do make use of libraries like cats, but at the same time we heavily favor core language features and have no intention of rewriting everything using Free Monads.- Our frontend is written in Typescript with Angular2 and a supporting API running on Node, and is deployed and monitored using much the same supporting tech as the backend.- Other services we use include: GitHub, CircleCI, DataDog.Find out about Company Culture: http://transparency.narrative.io/culture/Apply at hiring@narrative.io.

For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. We pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside.

Our Stack: Ruby/Rails/React/PostgreSQL https://stackshare.io/stackshare. https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/09/developer-social-network-s...How we work:Every engineer owns and is responsible for the products they build (e.g. Stack News). Before writing any code, the engineer tagged to the product writes a blog post announcing it to the StackShare community. From there, they spec out the product in detail and get feedback from at least one other engineer. Once the initial version of the product is built they ship it to a small group of beta testers, gather feedback, and iterate. Once the product has shipped to production, this engineer is then responsible for monitoring the metrics that matter for this product and iterating to improve it. Since we're building a product for engineers, we believe in letting our engineers work on things that interest them and giving them ownership over these products.Interview process:Phone Screen -> Technical Homework -> Technical Interviews -> Product Interviews -> Offer!Check out our careers page: https://stackshare.io/careers Apply via AngelList or email us at careers+HN@stackshare.io - if you're emailing us please include your resume and/or LinkedIn profile URL!"

Who stick around longer and pay more. We have a moat of data and tactics that make us the best. Which is why big startups work with us for so long.  - Who we are: BellCurve.com is the top startup growth agency in SF. We grow mostly YC startups.
  - Clients include: Envoy, Clearbit, and Sentry. Plus a dozen more.
  - Our team: 6 engineers turned marketers. 
  - Approach: We emphasize data — not brand voice. We care about conversion — not brand marketing. 
  - Prior knowledge: We will teach you everything about advanced growth tactics.

We need someone who already:  - → Is personable and can bond with others over phone calls. This has to be a strength of yours.
  - → Is a strong writer.
  - → Has worked for at least 1 funded startup. Can't be brand new to startup life. (No interns.)
  - (If you're introverted and don't say much on a call, you won't be a good fit for this role.)

  - Lets data decide instead of exclusively relying on hunches.
  - Is passionate about a long-term future in growth marketing (aka growing startups).
  - Is able to quickly connect dots and come up with creative strategies on the spot.

We operate unlike a typical agency. (I wish there were a better term than ""agency."") We work with clients for a long time; we see them from start to finish. You'll get a front-row seat to some of the most interesting companies. We have a profound impact on our clients' businesses and product roadmaps. They listen to us. Because we have built a moat of data and tactics that others have not figured out. (I personally learned a lot from previously running growth for Heap and Webflow.)I have a hunch that A) operations/product leads, B) sociable engineers, and C) salespeople looking for something more than sales calls will be a great fit for this role.How to apply:  - → Email me (Julian Shapiro): jobs [at] bellcurve.com
  - → Kindly link me to your LinkedIn or attach a resume :)
  - Please note you must have experience working at a funded startup.
  - You must live in the US or Canada.
