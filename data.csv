- Software development (aside from building actual software, you'll need to read a lot of code to understand systems whose logic is not at database level).
- A mathematical bend, including awareness of and respect for the ideas behind the relational model (""predicate logic on sets"") as defined by Edgar Codd and Chris Date, and rich data types. If you see a foreign key as a mathematical domain and think in terms of relation values and variables, we are probably on the same page.
- Knowing your way around PostgreSQL, or failing that any large scale RDBMS deployment; there are infrastructure teams and DBAs but they need your guidance.
- At least some enjoyment of the resolution of large, complex problems using more abstract methods as opposed to quick hacks and duct tape.
- UNIX/Linux, but if you've read that far you probably have more than enough experience. 
- Speaking Chinese (Mandarin) may help a bit but the team has multiple native speakers. Interview process:
- Email vanessa.tan@lazada.com to be sent a few quick questions. Include ""6h9mYszLTq2Y"" in the subject line so we know you're not a bot.

We balance both to pay ourselves well and support our vision for the future. We're looking to get one final person in place to help us build our product, and that is hopefully you. We are incredibly selective (who isn't?) and we are really quite small. We've blogged about our hiring process and we've blogged about our funnel. The reality is we've optimized our hiring process to filter first, before a call.

You should be a great teammate who looks to make your colleagues more productive because you know they are doing the same for you.

Unfortunately, maximizing the value of data is often easier said than done.  On one side, transacting via individual point to point integrations carries a lot of overhead in both business development and technical integration efforts.  On the other, going through big aggregators introduces opacity in the pricing and provenance of the data.  At Narrative, we help our customers get value from their data by building a central auction platform to reduce the friction and tooling to increase the transparency in this process. We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch.  Here's where we are now: - We are operating in Amazon Web Services.  Our services are mainly deployed on EC2 provisioned with Terraform. - We also heavily use other technology on AWS such as DynamoDB, S3, and RDS. - Our backend includes a data ingestion web service with supporting Kinesis consumers, along with a growing array of Spark projects.  It’s written mostly in Scala, with a smattering of Python for lambda functions. - We sit somewhere in the middle of the “Scala as a worse Haskell” and “Scala as a better Java” spectrum.  We love functional programming and we do make use of libraries like cats, but at the same time we heavily favor core language features and have no intention of rewriting everything using Free Monads. - Our frontend is written in Typescript with Angular2 and a supporting API running on Node, and is deployed and monitored using much the same supporting tech as the backend. - Other services we use include: GitHub, CircleCI, DataDog.

A couple of things I’m looking for in a candidate (in no particular order): <pre><code>    - the ability to multitask in a very fast paced environment.

    - highly skilled on both the frontend and backend. our stack is React + Rails.

    - solid fundamental understanding of how quality software is built, and best practices. 

    - an understanding of UI/UX, and a keen “eye” for design.  this is difficult to gauge, but its very important that we’re on a similar wavelength.

    - The ability to put development efforts in the context of business and customer needs. must be able to distinguish between what is “fun” and what’s “mission critical”. this is harder than it sounds.. emotions have a way of clouding judgement.

    - Fast speed and a high level of output. you should be able to deliver at least 2-3x faster than most. I work extremely fast so I expect as much from our lead engineer. I value execution much more than perfection.

16498556,"Academia.edu | Full Stack Engineer | San Francisco, CA | Onsite"," Academia.edu is addressing two problems: - Open access. The goal here is to put every academic pdf ever written on the internet, available for free. - Robustness. The goal here is to produce a set of signals around any given academic paper that indicate how robust the paper’s claims and findings are. It has emerged over the last few years that 65-90% of the academic literature is not reproducible. What this means is that if you try to reproduce the experiments described in a paper, 65-90% of the time you will not get the same findings. This is known as ""the reproducibility crisis”. Peer review is not a robustness filter; we need a separate filter to indicate robustness. With regard to open access, Academia allows academics to upload papers to Academia, and make them freely available. Academics have uploaded about 19 million pdfs to Academia.edu. About 30 million people come to Academia each month to access and share papers. With regard to robustness, we think the way to build a robustness layer on top of papers is a) to mine the existing graph of citations for commentary and (b) crowd-source commentary/peer review from the academic community. Academia has built a recommendation system which is the basis of our approach to (b), and a citation graph infrastructure that is the basis of our approach to (a). We believe that addressing robustness is a challenge and an opportunity. We need mission-driven engineers to come and help us. We have raised $33 million from Tencent, Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. The company is profitable off a premium subscription model. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes ""We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world.""

16053717,"CargoMate Technologies | Front-end JavaScript Engineer | London | Onsite, Full-time, £40K-£60K + 0.5-1.25% Equity, "," CargoMate Technologies brings innovative efficiency to the container shipping industry. We’re developing a range of applications and technologies to record, monitor and analyse container ship cargo operations (i.e. the process of moving containers on and off a ship in port), to ensure ships depart early and consume less fuel on voyage. Our long-term goal is to bring the widespread adoption of autonomous technologies to merchant ships. Voyages by ship are legally classed as ‘adventures’. We see CargoMate as an adventure too; driven by passionate problem solvers who are resilient when faced with a storm. We reach our destination by working as one crew. We are backed by one of the UK’s most successful tech accelerators, Entrepreneur First. We care about our craft and it’s important to us that you do as well. We’re looking for someone with a couple of years of coding experience under their belt and who’s willing to learn on the job, as well as teach others. You write code that you’re proud of as you know you and your team members will be the ones maintaining and adding new features to it. You’ll work on a customer facing React.js website as well as an Android only React Native app. You don’t have to know our whole tech stack but it’s important that you’re willing to learn. You’ll collaborate closely with the CTO as we turn our proof of concept into an MVP ready for production. You’ll build new features, do code reviews, mentor future team members as well as have mentors around you. We keep up to date with the latest tech but know that bleeding edge usually puts you in an unstable spot. Our projects are written in Javascript, React.js, React Native and all use ES6. For this role, Javascript skills and culture fit are more important than a formal education. We don’t do whiteboard interviews or ask you how many golf balls fit in a 747. You will get to show that you know what you’re doing by coding on your own machine as part of the interview process. We see coding as a way of communication, it’s therefore important that you have excellent communication skills as well as fluency in written and spoken English. Our intention is to enable remote working and flexible working hours as soon as we can. As this is one of our first hires, we need you full-time on-site in our offices in central Richmond upon Thames. crew@cargomate.co.uk"

Networking is great for people who are very interested in learning how to operate things. They want to get to know how to use things in the world to their advantage and find ways to make them do useful things in concert. A programmer has to think more about how to get new, undiscovered or previously unimplemented behavior out of a system and do so reliably. Network engineers need to do that at a large scale as a small aspect - like when a network goes completely down and no one knows why. You have to discover how things are supposed to work, why they're not working, and how to get them to work again - that's support. They also have to be able to design at a large scale and understand pre-built connection templates (i.e. protocols) and follow them. And they need to be responsible for hundreds of customers access to information, utilities, and the business. We look for engineers with college degrees in sciences and technology.

There are a lot of fascinating and challenging problems in this area: computing taxi times, landing times, departure times, airport congestion, flight delays, and more based on complex real-time contextual information. I honestly believe these are among the most interesting problems you'll find to work on almost anywhere. FlightAware has a vast amount of highly granular flight data going back many years to facilitate tackling these problems. For instance, we have detailed surface movement data for all aircraft on the ground at most major worldwide airports. We have detailed weather records and radar imagery. We have thousands of live ADS-B receivers around the world. And we've partnered with Aireon to deploy ADS-B receivers in space on dozens of satellites in orbit; this will allow us to achieve global tracking coverage, even over the oceans and other large bodies of water. FlightAware wants to be on the forefront of tackling these problems using modern, sophisticated methods. We view this as a long-term strategic initiative for the company. You'd be the first full-time machine learning engineer, so we're looking for someone fairly senior and experienced. You won't be a cog in the machine. This is not just a research position and will involve building end-to-end production systems, from training pipelines to real-time inference engines, so we're ideally looking for someone with a demonstrated track record of doing so. With that said, we're willing to consider less experienced candidates with exceptional backgrounds. FA is a small company (currently 70-80 employees), but we're not a startup. We've been around for over a decade and don't rely on VC funding at all. The company is successful, profitable, and growing. And we just built out a brand new modern office space in Houston. <a href=""https://flightaware.com/about/careers/position/ml_engineer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://flightaware.com/about/careers/position/ml_engineer</a> If interested, please email me through the address in my HN profile.

Are you the kind of person that just can't leave a question unanswered? Do you really want to know how things work, and share that knowledge with your team and the wider community? Do you understand how people and technology can come together to craft something special, each reshaping the other? Endjin are hiring developers at all levels, from apprentices to seniors, to work on exciting projects with clients from all over the world, in verticals from retail to financial services, utilities and media. We build modern data platforms in the cloud, and use them to help businesses adopt machine learning, data science, and automation. We work with fascinating new technologies like Service Fabric, Reactor, Cosmos DB, and Data Lake to develop novel software architecture at the boundaries of hyperscale computing, for our clients, our own internal IP, and partners like Microsoft. We increase our value by using our products, blueprints and library of intellectual property, sharing the benefit with our clients and partners. We value life-long learning and an eye for quality. We will help you to find the best learning techniques, tools, and team-working, so that you can achieve your potential, and deliver the best value to our clients; while balancing your personal goals and home life. Our employees have a mutual respect, regardless of where they are in their career. Ideas are developed by the whole team, from interns to seniors. Equally, our clients pass the ""nice to work for"" test (and usually do so with flying colours). As part of that, we try to understand the ethical implications of the work we undertake. We seek to do the best we can for each other, for our profession, clients, and for the world at large.
With no external investors, endjin has been built as a sustainable, lifelong business: we are a company to retire out of, not exit at the expense of the employees. You can work remotely from anywhere in the UK, and we hold meet-ups in London on a regular basis. You design your ideal working environment, and we will make it happen together. Apart from a real passion for learning, you probably dream in data - how it can be represented, handled, secured and manipulated. A bit of maths improves your day. You know a couple of programming languages pretty well (we do a lot of C# and Typescript, but you may know R, or Python too). You love working with other people, but value the opportunity to spend time in your own head, thinking things through. You can learn more about our projects at Contact us on hello-at-endjin-dot-com if you think this looks like a good opportunity for you."

In addition to great products, over time you’ve also built your set of soft skills. You can not only solve problems but also communicate your solutions to others. You may have been exposed to stuff like office politics and ladder climbing, and rightfully decided you want nothing to do with it. You prefer to disseminate knowledge rather than gossip.

On the other, going through big aggregators introduces opacity in the pricing and provenance of the data.  At Narrative, we help our customers get value from their data by building a central auction platform to reduce the friction and tooling to increase the transparency in this process. We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch.

It’s written mostly in Scala, with a smattering of Python for lambda functions. - We sit somewhere in the middle of the “Scala as a worse Haskell” and “Scala as a better Java” spectrum.  We love functional programming and we do make use of libraries like cats, but at the same time we heavily favor core language features and have no intention of rewriting everything using Free Monads. - Our frontend is written in Typescript with Angular2 and a supporting API running on Node, and is deployed and monitored using much the same supporting tech as the backend. - Other services we use include: GitHub, CircleCI, DataDog.

Look at the startups hiring on this thread, and imagine running the security team for, like, a bunch of them simultaneously. That’s what we’re about. You’d want to be interested in that problem to make reading further worth your time. We’re currently 6 security-researcher software-developers. We find groups of startups with similar technical security challenges, and then automate and systematize. Everything that’s fun about application security — crawling through the ventilation ducts of software skyscrapers like John McClane, being a scary story told to baby software developers to keep them up at night — is fun about what we do. Mix in blue-team tooling, and that’s where we are. We’re hiring our first non-partner employee. Salaried, with benefits. Requirements: extremely interested in security, can code well in some language, willing to read and code in any language. Offices in Chicago and NYC (WFH fine, but we need to see you regularly). What we cannot promise: a clear job description, a refined hiring process. We’re figuring that stuff out now. What we can promise: honest and direct answers to serious inquiries regardless of your experience or perceived skill level. jobs@latacora.com <a href=""https://www.latacora.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.latacora.com</a>"
